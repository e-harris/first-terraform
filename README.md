# Terraform

Terraform is a orchestration tool, that is part of IaS, Infrastructure as Code.

Where Chef and Packer sit more on the **configuaration** management side and create imutable AMIs.

Terraform **orchestrates** the creation of networks and complex systems and deploys AMI.

An AMI is a blue print (snapshot) of an instance:
- the operating system
- data and storage
- all the packages and exact state of a machine when AMI was created
